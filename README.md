**Power BI Infographics: Visualizing Complex Concepts**

A collection of interactive, animated infographics designed to demystify complex Power BI concepts like Star Schemas and DAX Filter Contexts.

üåü About This Project

This repository is dedicated to making advanced Power BI topics easy and fun to learn. By using interactive web-based animations, we transform intricate ideas into simple, visual metaphors, helping you grasp key concepts faster and more effectively.

Our goal is to provide a go-to resource for developers, data analysts, and anyone looking to level up their Power BI skills.

üé® Animations Included

Each animation is a self-contained HTML file that you can open directly in your web browser.

1. The Star Schema Filter Flow

An interactive visual that demonstrates how filters cascade from dimension tables to the central fact table in a star schema. It highlights the standard unidirectional relationships and the special bidirectional relationship used for the customer dimension.

2. The DAX Filter Context Water Plant

This infographic visualizes the DAX filter context hierarchy as a water filtration plant. It shows how filters from different levels (Report, Page, Visual, etc.) are applied sequentially and how the powerful CALCULATE() function can override these filters, with the exception of Row-Level Security (RLS).

üöÄ How to Use

Simply clone this repository and open any of the HTML files in your browser. The animations are built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so no special software or server is required.
Bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SRathinagGiri/PowerBI.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd PowerBI

# Open an animation
open StarSchema.html
